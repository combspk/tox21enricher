If you have the startQueue.sh script configured to always restart on crash but need to kill the process for whatever reason,
follow these directions (note that these instructions are intended for the server admin with superuser privileges only):

1) run "ps aux | gep startQueue.sh" to get the PID of the queue process
2) run "sudo gdb -p <PID of queue process>" to hook into the process
3) run "call exit(0)" from within gdb to exit the process with status code = 0
